# Introduction

Research Paper: Local demographic changes and US presidential voting, 2012 to 2016

Authors: Seth J. Hilla, Daniel J. Hopkins, and Gregory A. Huberc

Thi PDF document present an initial overview of the replication exercise through a high-level visual presentation and a textual overview of the authors' findings and methods.

# Overview
The topics of immigration and the increase of racial and ethnic minorities have been fairly prevalent in media, social media, and political rhetoric over the last few years, but do these phenomena actually influence voting behavior? This study analyzes voting patterns in areas that received an influx of immigrants prior to the 2016 general election. Notably, using precinct-level data, it finds that these influxes did not influence voting behavior in favor of Trump, but rather (in a slight way) benefited his opponent in those particular areas. In other words, local demographic changes are not, on their own, increasing support for anti-immigration candidates. The authors argue that this means the cities in question are not engaging in the often suggested “threatened response” associated with voting behavior in light of immigration influxes. The authors acknowledge that "despite its disparate local impacts, immigration may be a symbolic, nationalized issue whose effects, do not depend on local experiences." However, the actual connection has yet to be proven empirically and it is tough to do so given several factors influencing voting patterns. Some of these factors include, but are not limited to, greater exposure to international trade and declining economic prospects for the less educated. The authors explain that 'positive intergroup contact' could be responsible for the seemingly 'supportive' voting patterns at low levels of aggregation (locally). 


The authors use 8 main regression models as well as loess lines in their analysis. They study change in proportion of Hispanics and proportion change of Hispanic proportions concluding that in places with demographic shifts, Trump did not benefit, but, in fact, Clinton did. These findings are further validated by a similar model utilizing foreign-born, noncitizens proportions to discard the posibility of increased Clinton support due to changing electoral composition (given that noncitizens cannot vote and would not influence the electoral outcome in such way) [@research]. I am interested in exploring this topic further by analyzing the variables used and figuring out whether this conclusion stands across demographic groups. In addition, this paper evokes an interest in understanding how Trump’s nationalist rhetoric and media’s portrayal of immigration influxes may have attracted different demographic groups in cities that did not experience such influx (fearing that they might) i.e. the Deep South. 

Dan Hopkins offers a link to the data for this research paper on [his website](http://web.sas.upenn.edu/danhop/research/">his website).

Research on the United Kingdom has found that support for Brexit, the UK Independence Party, and reducing immigration are higher in localities that have low immigrant shares but recent demographic changes (21–23), with related research in continental Europe (24, 25).

# A Beautiful Graphic



```{r graphic, warning = FALSE}

# This graphic is an initial attempt to replicate Fig. 1A from the paper:

# Change in Republican vote share, 2012 to 2016, and change in Hispanic
# population 2011-2016. Note: Points are random samples of 2,000 precincts.
# Loess lines are generated from all observations. Points are shaded
# corresponding to density, with darker colors indicating more precincts.

# My graphic complies with the first two lines of that description. I am using
# the sample function to get a random sample from my geo_scope dataset. I used
# the geoscope dataset because I wanted to color the dots by state, which the
# authors do not do, but I thought would be interesting and prettier. I was able
# to create the loess line using geom_smooth, which does not appear disimilar to
# the paper's model. I also added the aesthetic enhancement of size as number of
# voters in 2016 in each precinct.

geo_scope2 <- geo_scope %>% 
  drop_na()

try2 <- sample_n(geo_scope2, 2000)
  
# With every sample ran a different number of non-finite/missing values exists,
# and a warning sign appears. Because these values are not relevant to the
# graphic I'm constructing, I will ignore this warnings.



try2 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = gop_propvote_change, y = d1611_hispanic, size = Total_Voters_2016_Prct)) +

My graphic shows the association between changes of Republican vote share and Hispanic population proportion changes over the same period of time. I am using the sample function to get a random sample of 2000 observations from my geo_scope dataset. I used the geoscope dataset because I wanted to color the observations by state, which the authors do not do, but I thought would be interesting and prettier. I was able to create the loess line using geom_smooth and it does not appear disimilar to the original paper's model[@smooth]. I also added the aesthetic enhancement of size as number of voters in 2016 in each precinct[@ggplot].

To create this graphic I utilized several online guides cited in the References section of this paper[@data].

         state_d1611_hispanic = mean(d1611_hispanic),
         state_pop12 = sum(weight),
         state_pop16 = sum(Total_Voters_2016_Prct))


new_data <- inner_join(county_data, geo_scope, by = "stcofips") %>% 
  filter(st %in% c("FL", "OH", "WA", "PA", "MI")) %>% 
  group_by(st)

# Appendix 

### Table Replication

Replication of Table 1:

Robust standard errors are in parentheses. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01. Precinct-level analysis; weighted to number of votes 2012; proportional changes top and  bottom coded at 1 and −1. Note: Dependent variable is change in GOP vote share, 2012 to 2016. Prop., proportion

```{r table1, results="asis"}

# AnalyzePooledPrecinctLevelFiles.do 

# Estimate the effect of changing Hispanic population on change in Republican
# vote share from 2012 to 2016.

# Note that the authors create local variables in stata that mean different
# variables depending on the model that the regression is running. The local
# variables used in stata for the regressions in Table 1 are outlined within the
# if_else statement starting with "if `modelgroups'==1". The definitions
# outlined in it run through the standard regressions the authors built at the
# bottom of the document that apply to all of the tables/models within the
# if_else statement.


# Table 1 has eight regression models. I'll replicate each of them in R and then
# try to display them all together to mimic the paper's output.


# IMPORTANT: this note refers to the order in which translation of the stata
# local variables should take place.
