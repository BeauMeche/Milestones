Submit a one paragraph html to Canvas which summarizes, in your own words, your paper. 

Include the url of your repo so we can check it out, if we choose to. In the repo, you must include a copy of the code of the original paper, interspersed with several pages of your own comments, and reformatted to meet our coding style guidelines.
