### Working Documents for GOV1006 Final Project 

This project contains the milestones and working documents relating to my final project for GOV1006 at Harvard University.

It includes data and code (kindly shared by Dan Hopkins and his colleages on dataverse) related to Local demographic changes and US presidential voting, 2012 to 2016: [https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/J5GCZQ]

The study analyzes voting patterns in areas that received an influx of  immigrants prior to the 2016 general election. Notably, using precinct-level data, it finds that these influxes did not influence voting behavior in favor of Trump, but rather (in a slight way) benefited his opponent in those particular areas. In other words, local demographic changes are not on their own increasing support for anti-immigration candidates. The authors argue that this means the cities in question are not engaging in the previously suggested “threatened response” associated with voting behavior. I am interested in exploring this topic further by analyzing the variables used and figuring out whether this conclusion stands across demographic groups.

The study uses a lot of proportion change variables to uncover how changes to different demographics affect voting patterns in the areas studied.
